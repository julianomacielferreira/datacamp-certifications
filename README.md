# My DataCamp Certifications

This is a repository to show the certifications of courses I made at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com).

**I've subscribed [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/pricing) for a long period of time and enjoyed the maximum I could**. Watching the videos and doing a lot of exercises (some are very funny, I have to say).

My DataCamp profile link is [https://www.datacamp.com/profile/julianomacielferreira](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/julianomacielferreira)

**In this moment I'm not working professionally as a Data-[Analyst, Engineer, Sciencist]** or using all the knowledge and tools I've learned from them, but I highly recommend people make a subscription and give a try.

In general, It'll improve your problem solving skills and they have real challenging exercises / projects with a strong pedagogy and best learn practices.

If you are a very curious person like me, I think [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) is one of the best places to learn and practice Data Science fundamentals and related tools.
